# Full Adder Implementation with Machine Learning and Streamlit

## Project Description
- This project demonstrates the implementation of a full adder using machine learning techniques and interactive visualization with Streamlit. A full adder is a fundamental digital circuit used to perform binary addition of three bits: two significant bits and a carry-in bit. By leveraging machine learning models, we predict the outputs (Sum and Carry-out) based on input values and deploy an interactive web application to visualize and explore the full adder's behavior.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python: Programming language used for implementing machine learning models and the Streamlit application.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to train RandomForestClassifier models for predicting the Sum and Carry-out.
- Streamlit: Framework used to create the interactive web application for user input and visualization.
- NetworkX: Library used for creating and visualizing the full adder logic circuit.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library used for generating visualizations of the logic circuit and truth table.
- Pandas: Data manipulation library used for creating and managing the dataset.
- Pickle: Library used for saving and loading trained machine learning models.

## Usage
- Input Fields: Enter values for A, B, and Carry-in using the provided dropdown menus.
- Submit Button: Click to get predictions for Sum and Carry-out.
- Visualization: View the dynamically updated logic circuit and truth table based on the input values.
